; reads an input, stores it at 1000, stores it at 1001, prints the input at 1001
; if the input is 0, calls func and exits, else reproduces the previous steps
; func read an input and stores it at 1000, push the input onto the stack, duplicates it onto the stack
; op 15 takes replaces the duplicated input on the stack by its opposite, then sum with the original input
; result must be 0 

here:   read 1000
        push# 1000
        ipush
        push# 1001
        ipop
        write 1001
        push 1001
        jnz here
        call func
        halt
        
func:   read 1000
        push 1000
        dup
